# core-brainframe
CORE is a knowledge-first, safety-gated local AI brain frame for a robot assistant. It routes input through commands → safety → local knowledge → (optional) cloud LLM, with strict modes (general/tutor/focus/health/mood), lightweight memory, and sensor-ready interfaces for future camera/robot integration.
